\section{Lab-Scale Filtration Setup}

Experiments performed in relation to this project will be  filtration on a lab-scale setup developed in collaboration with Grundfos. 
%A lab-scale set up is a scaled down version which allow for a smaller water volume and easier control of parameters. 
%and experiments were conducted in order to understand the processes which could later be scaled to a pilot plan filtration system. 
All filtration were performed using a lab-scale hollow fiber, inside-out NF membrane obtained by NXFiltration (MexFil MPO25 dNF40). 
%optimal operation condition for the the lab-scale dNF40 membrane is listed in \rod{appendix: membrane_stads}.
%This membrane was selected based on internal work at Grundfos, 
This membrane achieves high rejection of divalent ions and is rated for 91\% rejection of \ce{MgSO4}, and is robust with a wide range for operational conditions, see \textcolor{blue}{appendix: membrane stads}. 
In order to compare with manufacturers stated performance a single pass filtration of \ce{MgSO4} was performed and achieved 95 \% rejection of \ce{Mg+} and 97 \% of \ce{SO4-} and thus exceeds the expected performance.

The lab-scale NF membrane was operated in cross-flow mode due to the membrane configuration, to achieve high permeate flux, and reduce fouling. 
The hollow fiber configuration leads to a large active membrane area in a compact membrane configuration. \textcolor{blue}{kilde på det}
The stated active surface area of the membrane is \SI{0.05}{\square\meter} 
%with a cylindrical module size of 30 cm long and a 2.4 cm diameter. 
however this value is associated with a moderate amount uncertainty due to the manufacturers difficulties in precisely determining the area of such a small membrane.  \citep{Datasheet_dNF40_labscale_2019}

The lab-scale filtration system was designed, 
%were both single pass and batch experiments were possible. 
so the system could be operated semi-automated, by the use of a PLC programmed to operate valves and pumps along with collecting data every second from various sensors, see \textcolor{blue}{figure for illustration of lab-scale set-up}.
Two Grundfos dosing pumps (SMART Digital XL 60 L/h) were used to generate feed flow, as well as a dosing pump for the permeate side for backwash.
The system had a \SI{100}{\micro\meter} pre-filter installed to remove larger particulates before the NF membrane.
A magnetic flow meter measured the feed flow rate which was used to regulate the crossflow velocity.
Due to the usage of dosing pumps, pulsation dampeners were present to the system to reduce pulsation in the flow.
In order to monitor and control the filtration process and performance multiple sensors were present in the system. 
Pressure sensors were placed on the feed, retentate and permeate sides of the membrane to monitor the TMP. 
%Information from these sensors was used to estimate current membrane performance and to monitor degrading membrane performance to know when mechanical or chemical cleaning was necessary.
Conductivity sensors were present before and after the membrane.
This allowed using the conductivity measurements as a first approach to determine ion rejections and membrane performance. 
pH sensors were placed on the feed side of the membrane to monitor changes in pH of the feed solution. 
%The filtration system including various gauges and valves is illustrated on \Cref{fig:PID_system}.
A custom regulation-valve controlled the flow of the retentate stream by constricting the tubing via a motorized actuator, this allowed regulation of pressure to run in constant flux mode. 
%The pressure regulation was achieved by this valve as the feed flow was more or less constant and the retentate tube became constricted.
%The system was operated in constant flux mode, where the system regulated the pressure to maintain a constant water flux over the membrane.
The permeate flow rate was determined by continuously weighing accumulated permeate on a scale \textcolor{blue}{[stads på vægt]} and averaging over a time period.  
Based on this lab scale experimental setup operation in either batch process or single-pass is possible.




\subsection{System Operation}
\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{Single pass and batch operation mode}
    \label{fig:batch_vs_single_pass_system_operation_mode}
\end{figure}



\textbf{Batch}
In batch configuration the retentate stream is continuously returned to the feed tank during filtration.
Therefore, the concentration of most species will increase as the filtration progresses.
As water is filtered multiple times, greater water recoveries can be achieved by batch filtration.


Water recovery was selected based on the recovery of NF-pilot plant which is 92.95 \%.



\textbf{Single Pass}
In the single pass configuration the retentate stream is led to the drain.
The water is only led over the membrane once and therefore water recovery is very low, especially for the bench-scale system.

\textcolor{blue}{Noget med Steady State}


% Internal work at Grundfos has investigated ideal filtration parameters, which have been used to run a larger pilot scale NF filtration set-up, which will be elaborated in \rod{ref til chapter omkring NF pilot}. %present at Grundfos. 
%Results from previous work done at Grundfos, found that a flux above 20 LMH and cross flow above 0.5 m/s does not yield significantly higher rejection based on conductivity \citep{Sebastians_master_2020}.
The filtration conditions are selected based on Grundfos internal work on a pilot scale NF system.
The filtrations are therefor run in constant flux mode at a  permeate flux of 20 LMH and crossflow velocity of 0.5 m/s, as these match the pilot scale system. 
When operating in batch mode, water recovery should targeted to be above 90 \% both to keep water savings  high and as the pilot setup is capable of reaching close to this water recovery. 
%for the lab-scale experimental set-up will therefore be determined to best resemble that of the pilot scale NF filtration set up.


%Permeate flux was 20 LMH at cross flow velocity of 0.5 m/s, these parameters match the pilot scale system.
%The filtration parameters were selected to best resemble a pilot scale NF plant present at Grundfos.
%, where only some of these parameters are possible to mimic for a lab scale system. 
\subsection{Sample Analysis}
Samples are collected from the retentate and permeate streams during filtration.
The samples were analyzed for anions and cations using IC \textcolor{blue}{(stads)}, and bicarbonate was analyzed by a total alkalinity test \textcolor{blue}{(according to noget DS)}, at an internal Grundfos laboratory.                                     
Furthermore samples containing \ce{Na2OSiO2} were also analyzed for \ce{SiO2} using silicomolybdate method \textcolor{blue}{(performed with Hack lange test kits)}.

\subsection{Membrane Cleaning}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item hydraulic cleaning once pr. hour. 
%     \item irreversible fouling on membrane can be removed by cleaning in place (CIP) 
%     \item backwash use permeate water. 
% \end{itemize}

%Cleaning of the membrane is necessary over time to remove fouling, and can be divided into two categories; Hydraulic cleaning and chemical cleaning. \citep{NXfiltration_operation_manual} 
For experiments performed on the lab-scale filtration system, hydraulic cleaning will be performed between filtration by flushing the membrane with tap-water at 1000 ml/min for 5 min. 
%This helps remove solids which are present on the membrane surface \citep{NXfiltration_operation_manual}.  
Following a 15 min backwash with \textcolor{blue}{600 ml/min ??} is performed where permeate quality water flows through the membrane in opposite direction this helps remove foulants. \citep{NXfiltration_operation_manual}
%Feed or tap water will be used for flush during hydraulic cleaning. 


%The preferred regular hydraulic cleaning is flush, where solids which lie on the membrane surface can be removed by flushing the membrane with water at higher velocity than used during filtration. 
%The flush should take place for minimum 1-2 minutes and the permeate water is the preferred water quality but feed water can also be used. 
%As a supplement to flush backwash can be used as a hydraulic cleaning to maintain an acceptable permeability.
%In backwash water of permeate quality  flow through the membrane in opposite direction of filtration, and remove foulants from the membrane surface.  
%It is recommended to perform backwash with similar flux rate as filtration flux. \textcolor{blue}{KILDE = lang manual fra NXfiltration}


% If hydraulic cleaning is not sufficient to remove foulants, a chemical cleaning can be performed. 
% %A chemical cleaning should be performed if the TMP increase to higher than 30 \% of start-up values.  
% A chemical cleaning can be performed in the form of chemically enhanced flush (CEF), where chemicals are dosed to the feed side of the membrane during a flush.  \citep{NXfiltration_operation_manual} 
%When performing a CEF an alkaline cycle using sodium hydroxide to reach pH 11.5-12 in combination with sodium hypochlorite for disinfection has proven effective in removing organic fouling. Where a cycle using an acid flush is effective at removing precipatation of salt.    textcolor{blue}{KILDE = lang manual fra NXfiltration}
Chemical cleaning will be performed between different experiments to ensure best membrane performance, if scaling is observed or large increases in TMP are observed. 
% The chemical cleaning is designed based on NXfiltrations recommendation \citep{NXfiltration_operation_manual} as well as internal practice within Grundfos. 
% Due to the size of the lab-scale a volume of 3 liter of each cycle is prepared. 
An alkaline cycle is prepared with 20 mM Sodium Hydroxide to increase pH to 11.5-12 and 2.7 mM Sodium Hypochlorite.  
This alkaline cycles is intended to disinfect and  remove organic fouling.  \citep{NXfiltration_operation_manual}. 
An acidic cycle is prepared to remove precipitated salts by adjusting the solution to pH 2 with %0.1 mM eller 1 mM 
Citric acid and heating it to 40 \textdegree{}C. 
Each cycle is flushed for a minimum of 15 min, longer if needed. 
Before and after each cycle the system is flushed with RO-water to ensure that no chemicals are left in the system.
