\section{ICR (Increase Chloride Rejection)}

To investigate the rejection of chloride an experiment similar to "the complex ion matrix" were performed. A filtration was performed with sampling every 20 min for 6 hours of both feed and permeate. Where  "the complex ion matrix" filtrations had sampling after 2.5 or 3 hours.
This more frequent sampling was done to investigate the chloride rejection during the whole filtration as "the complex ion matrix" filtrations achieved primarily negative rejection of chloride. 
The filtration carried out with the same procedure as for "the complex ion matrix" with the concentrations presented in \cref{tab:ICR_phase_1_conc} and at pH 9.5.
