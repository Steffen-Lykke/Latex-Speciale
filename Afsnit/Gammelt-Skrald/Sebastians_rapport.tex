\textbf{Results}\citep{Sebastians_master_2020}

System was stable (steady state) within one hour.
Rejection is very dependent on composition of the salt system, as it must fulfill charge neutrality. e.g. rejection of Na+ is 35 \% when \ce{Cl-} is present but it rejection of Na+ is 35 \% when \ce{SO4^{-2}} is present.
NXFiltration state 30 \% rejection of NaCl and 98 \% rejection of NaSO4. 
Concentration has little - no effect on rejection. 1.5 mM and 6 mM give same rejection in single salt experiments.

Peeters report: if there is decreased rejection as function on salt concentration the rejection is governed by charge. 
Membranes governed by steric effect have little - no impact on rejection with change in salt concentration. 

\textbf{multi salt experiment}
Sulphate rejection is independent of composition of feed, rejection between 97-99 \%. 

Calcium rejection is independent on composition of Na and Ca in feed, but calcium rejection increase when sulphate ratio increase (close to 100 \% rejection when 100\% SO4) and decrease when Cl ratio increase (rejection about 60\% when Cl ratio 100\%). 

Sodium rejection decrease with increasing calcium ratio. Sodium rejection increase with higher sulphate ratio and decrease with increasing chloride ratio. 

Chloride increase slightly with higher Calcium ratio. Chloride rejection decrease with increasing sulphate ratio. giving negative rejection. 

sodium probably more effected by potential difference compared to calcium due to size difference, making sodium more mobile in comparison. 


\textbf{Silica}
Silica rejection 12 \%, he found literature with rejection 14 \%. 


sammenligner man sebastians resultater med vores på single salt har han fået højere rejection end vores fra single salt? WTF.
