\textcolor{blue}{NX filtration technical report (fra Pernille) }

\begin{itemize}
    \item Operated in cross-flow mode.
    \item inside-out, inner of fiber is feed side and outer side is permeate. 
    \item hydraulic cleaning once pr. hour. 
    \item irreversible fouling on membrane can be removed by cleaning in place (CIP) 
    \items backwash use permeate water. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{NF solution-diffusion model:} where molecules dissolve in and diffuse through separation layer of membrane.
