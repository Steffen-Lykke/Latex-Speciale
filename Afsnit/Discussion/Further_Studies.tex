NF and RO are rensisble to irreversible fouling, Coagluation-filtration and UF as pretreatment could be a possibility to compact fouling on NF/RO membranes and thus decrease problems related to fouling such as, operation cost, energy demand, memrbane cleaning lifespan of the memrbane.  \citep{farahanniRecoveryCoolingTower_2016}
